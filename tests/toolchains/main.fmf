test: ./test.sh
adjust:
  - environment+:
      CXXLIBS: "libc++"
    require:
      - clang
      - libcxx-devel
    when: "distro == fedora"
    because: testing against libcxx package in Fedora
  - environment+:
      CXXLIBS: "libstdc++"
    require:
      - clang
      - libstdc++
    when: "distro == rhel"
    because: testing against libstdc++ package in RHEL as libcxx is not shipped with RHEL
# TODO REVIEW: are these all requirements? test.sh seems to run quite a lot of stuff, looks like we
# need more packages from LLVM family.
