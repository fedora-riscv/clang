# TODO REVIEW: get fitting summary - what's the purpose of this test? Comment from the STI version says:
#
# This is separate from tests.yml because we want to run the tests without
# clang installed.
summary: pocl

adjust:
  - because: "PoCL is shipped with Fedora, not RHEL"
    when: "distro == rhel"
    enabled: false

# This test requires a special preparation, see `/tests/tests-pocl` plan. As such,
# it shouldn't be part of the `/tests/default` plan.
