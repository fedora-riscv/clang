# TODO: get fitting summary - what's the purpose of this test? Comment from the STI version says:
#
# We want to make sure libomp is not already present on the system to ensure
# that clang pulls in the correct libomp dependencies when it is installed.
summary: libomp tests
# This test requires a special preparation, see `/tests/tests-libomp` plan. As such,
# it shouldn't be part of the `/tests/default` plan.
